alfred-file-metadata
====================

Shows metadata for a file in Alfred

To use, either type "meta /path/to/file" or use the file actions "Metadata (Show)" and "Metadata (Copy to Clipboard)" on a selected file.

"Show" will display each metadata attribute separately in Alfred, with the actioned one copied to the clipboard.
"Copy to clipboard" will copy all metadata found for the item.

Currently works best on media files, only rudimentary data will be returned for other types.
